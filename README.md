3. **Correlation Analysis:**
   - Explore the relationship between the amount of funding raised by companies and the number of layoffs.

4. **Visualizations:**
   - Create visualizations such as bar charts, pie charts, and time series plots to illustrate trends and distributions of layoffs.

### Data Cleaning and EDA:
I have performed data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to ensure the quality and reliability of the dataset. Below is the sql code, ready for further analysis
